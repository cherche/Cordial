# Cordial
The project that powers Fuchsia.

## Installation
Obtain your `cordial.js` file through whatever means you wish (downloading, `git clone`, etc.).

Now just link to it in your HTML file like so:

```html
<script src="cordial.js"></script>
```

## Usage
The old documentation is now *very* outdated and will be rewritten soon.

## Contributing
Since I lack time for testing, if you come across anything you would like added into Cordial, just [open up and issue](https://github.com/Loquacious/Cordial/issues/new) or add it yourself and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Loquacious/Cordial/compare) if you really feel like it!
